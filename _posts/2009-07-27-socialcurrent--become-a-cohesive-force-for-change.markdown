A friend just launched his website, [SocialCurrent](http://www.socialcurrent.org).  The idea brings the Tao Te Ching to mind. 

All things spring up and there is not one which declines to show itself.  
They grow and there is no claim made for their ownership.  
The go through their processes and there no expectation of a reward for their results.  
The work is accomplished, and there is no resting in it as an achievement.  
The work is done, but how no one can see. 'Tis this that makes the power not cease to be.  

Everyday we do things in our daily life that we perceive as socially responsible, yet our actions sometimes invisible. These invisible things add up and the actions of one person can truly make a difference.
