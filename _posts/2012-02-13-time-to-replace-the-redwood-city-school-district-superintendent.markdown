It's time for the Redwood City School District to Jan Christensen as Superintendent.

[Recent allegations](http://www.mercurynews.com/top-stories/ci_19941697 ) of teacher abuse in a Redwood City elementary school highlight some of the failures of the district administration under Ms. Christensen's watch.

> An attorney for the parents of a 5-year-old autistic boy who authorities say was abused by a Redwood City School District
> special education teacher said the parents' complaints about the teacher ... were ignored

> "When they raised concerns, they were made to feel stupid," attorney Chris Dolan said of the parents, who he said aired their concerns to ... the district.
> "They were made to feel like, 'Shut up, we know what we're doing.' "
 
There have been other [instances](http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/06/14/BAA41JU1D2.DTL) in the past that show a similar lack of accountability.

My personal opinion is that Ms. Christensen is not qualified to hold the position of Superintendent, and that her tenure has been detrimental to the School District. I base this opinion on the fact that it appears her qualifications were falsified in order for her to obtain her position, and on impressions gathered in a private, face-to-face meeting with her.

What I know:

### **Misrepresentation of Title**
The Redwood City School District's web page about the  [Superintendent](http://www.rcsd.k12.ca.us/domain/9) states that she was "adjunct professor at University of Alaska Anchorage". I contacted Seanna Alto, Staff Directory File Clerk at University of Alaska, to verify this information and was told it was inaccurate. Ms. Christensen was, in fact, "Temporary Faculty" and the correct title she should have used is "Adjunct Faculty". While the distinction may appear minor, it is evidence of a manipulation of facts employed to produce a more desirable (and an untrue) CV.

### **Inaccuracies in Employment History**
The Redwood City School District's website further states that "From July 2001 to April 2006 Ms. Christensen was the Anchorage School District's assistant superintendent for curriculum and instruction." The evidence does not support this claim. A staff directory from the Anchorage School District, dated April 8, 2002, shows [Pat McDowell still held that position](http://www.mischievous.org/images/June2002DepartmentList.jpg). A [press release from the Anchorage School District dated February 12, 2002](http://www.mischievous.org/images/Appointed%20July%201%202002.pdf) announced that Ms. Christensen would assume the job on July 2002, a full year after to the start-date Ms. Christensen claims as her own for the same position.

### **Educational Ambiguities**
Lastly, the Redwood City School District's website claims that Ms. Christensen "has completed post-masters course work in leadership, curriculum, and instruction at Gonzaga University in their doctoral program." While this may be true, it is also euphemistic lanugage for a failure to complete a doctorate in the allotted time. The executive search firm that placed Ms. Christensen with the District "marketed" her as "[Dr. Jan Christensen](http://www.mischievous.org/images/JanChristensenTitleAsDr.jpg)" (they have subsequently corrected this "mistake" after my inquiry).

<a href="http://www.mischievous.org/images/JanChristensenTitleAsDr.jpg"><img alt="JanChristensenTitleAsDr.jpg" src="http://www.mischievous.org/assets_c/2012/02/JanChristensenTitleAsDr-thumb-300x169-17.jpg" width="300" height="169" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></a>

### **Employment Application Affidavit Concerns**
When an individual applies for employment with the Redwood City School District, he or she is required to provide accurate information and to agree that "The information provided in this application for employment is complete and accurate to the best of my knowledge. I understand that falsification of any part(s) of this application shall be sufficient cause for my disqualification from the selection process or termination from District employment." 
I believe we deserve to know if falsified information was provided by Jan Christensen in the signed application she submitted to the District. 

### **Missing Qualifications**
Some blame for hiring an unqualified individual as Superintendent falls clearly on the Redwood City School Board, as [California Education Code Section 35028](http://www.suspect.com/laws/California-Codes/Education-Code/sec-35028.html) requires a Superintendent to hold both a valid School Administration and Teaching certificate (see [California Commission on Teacher Credentialing](https://teachercred.ctc.ca.gov/teachers/PublicSearchProxy) ). 

> No person shall be eligible to hold a position as city
> superintendent, district superintendent, deputy superintendent,
> associate superintendent, or assistant superintendent of schools
> unless he is the holder of both a valid school administration
> certificate and a valid teacher's certificate, but any person
> employed as a deputy, associate, or assistant superintendent in a
> purely clerical capacity shall not be required to hold any
> certificate.

Superintendent Christensen has never held a valid California Teaching Certificate. 

But [California Education Code Section 35029](http://www.suspect.com/laws/California-Codes/Education-Code/sec-35029.html) allows that "A local governing board may waive any credential requirement for the chief administrative officer of the school district under its jurisdiction." Minutes from the board verify that this waiver was invoked during the hiring process to overcome Jan Christensen's qualification deficiencies.

Anecdotal evidence from [teacher voice](http://teachervoice.com/superintendent-reviews/Redwood-City-Elementary/10-632130/) also suggest that Ms. Christensen is ineffective in her position.

### **What Now?**
The Redwood City School District needs to fully investigate these issues especially related to the employment affidavit of Ms. Christensen.  Misleading statements about Ms. Christensen's qualifications should be corrected on the District's website.  The Redwood City School District needs to examine the lack of accountability and hold individuals accountable inorder to restore trust in the administration of our local school system.
